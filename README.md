# 3DLang - Interpreter for the 3D Language

The 3D Language is an esoteric programming language that takes place in a two dimensional plane and a time axis. It was introduced in the [ICFP Contest 2024](https://github.com/icfpcontest2024/icfpc2024). Its specification can be found [here](https://github.com/icfpcontest2024/icfpc2024/blob/main/static/3d/3d.md).
